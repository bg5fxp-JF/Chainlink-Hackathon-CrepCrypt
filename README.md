# CrepCrypt - A Decentralized Shoe Marketplace

## Inspiration

In recent years, online shoe marketplaces have faced numerous challenges that affect the confidence of both buyers and sellers. Issues such as the authenticity of shoes have left many customers frustrated and demanding refunds. The problem of dishonest product descriptions is equally troubling. Often, misleading pictures and descriptions result in buyer disappointment and seller hassles with returns. Additionally, the lack of information about the number of previous owners and the true extent of shoe usage leads to skepticism and devaluation.

We believe that blockchain technology can provide a better, more efficient solution to these problems. This is the motivation behind the creation of CrepCrypt, a decentralized shoe marketplace that utilizes NFTs and Chainlink functions to address these critical issues.

## What CrepCrypt Does

CrepCrypt allows users to list shoes for sale. Sellers are required to upload pictures of the shoes and provide accurate descriptions. These submissions are then verified by GPT4 Vision AI. If the AI confirms that the shoes are authentic and match the description provided, an NFT is generated, linked specifically to that pair of shoes. This process ensures that buyers can have confidence in the authenticity of their purchase. When buying the shoes, customers also acquire the corresponding NFT, adding an extra layer of security and trust to the transaction.
